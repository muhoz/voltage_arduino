                                              Code to measure voltage in Arduino with ZMPT101B
  This code is based on the ACS72. His datasheet can be find at this adress : https://www.alldatasheet.com/view.jsp?Searchword=ACS72&sField=2

  The connection with the sensor is relatively simple:

Arduino         ------------------      ZMPT101B

GND                 -------              GND

//////              -------              GND

5V                  -------              VCC

A7                  -------              OUT
